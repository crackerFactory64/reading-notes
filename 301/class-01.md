# Introduction to React and Components

In programming, a component is a set of functionality that makes up part of a larger whole. Components should be reusable, portable, and extensible among other things. Using components means it is easier for developers to make changes to software by seperating concerns.

In React, the Props keyword, short for properties, is used to pass data from a parent component to a child.
