## Class 05 - Design web pages with CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a language that is primarily used to change the default look of a HTML document.

There are three ways to insert CSS into a HTML document:

- use a _link_ tag inside the _head_ tag of the document that points to an external CSS file
- use the _style_ tag within the document itself
- use the style attribute within a HMTL element

The following CSS would select all of the _p_ tags within a document and make them red:

                p{
                    color: red;
                }
