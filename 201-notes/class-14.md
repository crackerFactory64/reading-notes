### Transforms

Transforms allow a developer to make visual changes to an element such as increasing or decreasing the scale of it, rotating it, or moving it. One way in which transform can be used on a website is by adding interactivity to an element by changing the size of a button when the user hovers over it.

### Transistions & Animations

Transistions differ from animations in that they only change between two styles whereras animations can use various keyframes to animate an element. Transistions are valuable because they over a simple way to create more dynamic web pages which enrich the user experience through added visual appeal.

## Psychological Safety

Psychologically safe teams are teams in which members trust each other to:

- experiment without judgement
- voice opinions without being shamed
- fail without being labelled a failure

Psychologically safe teams achieve better results because members feel safe to speak up when they feel they don't understand something or have doubts about a direction the team is going in which leads to discussion, learning, and ultimately a better performing team.
