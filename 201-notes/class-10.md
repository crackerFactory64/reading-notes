# Debugging and Error Handling

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

The majority of errors in programming fit into one of two categories: syntax errors and logic errors. Syntax errors are caused by a mistake in the actual writing of the code such as a typo or the improper structuring of a function call for example. Logic errors on the other hand are where the code is valid but produces unwanted results due to a problem with the logic of the script.

The JavaScript debugger is a tool that developers use to help them diagnose problems with their code.
