## Class 04 - HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

Q: To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
A: _a_

Q: The href attribute contains what information?
A: A URL

Q: What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
A: Ensure the link text is short and semantic. Make it clear that text is a link by following style conventions e.g. underlined, a different colour to regular text.

## CSS Layout

### FLow

In CSS normal flow refers to the default way in which elements are rendered on screen. By default, block elements appear one after each other top to bottom whereas inline elements appear next to each other horizontally.

### Positioning

The default _position_ value for every HTML element is _static_ which means it will follow the default flow. _Absolute_ postioning removes an element from normal flow and allows the developer to manually position an element using the _top_, _right_, _bottom_, and _left_ properties. A similar _position_ value to _absolute_ is _fixed_ but the key difference with _fixed_ is that the postion is based on the viewport whereas with _absolute_ it is based on the element's closest ancester element not in normal flow.
