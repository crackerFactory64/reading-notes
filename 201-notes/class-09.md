# Forms and JS Events

## HTML Forms

Forms are important in web development because they provide a simple, user-friendly way for visitors to a web page to interact with a web page by inputting data or controlling a user interface.

When designing a form it is important to consider the user experience (UX). Forms should be concise and focused while making use of the _label_ element to ensure it is clear to all users what each input corresponds to.

Top 5 form elements:

- input- the most common form element allows users to input text
- label- it is important to label form elements so users know what is expected of them
- textarea- better than _input_ for longer text
- select- used to create a dropdown list when the user is required to select from a range of preset answers
- checkbox- allows a user to select one or more preset options
