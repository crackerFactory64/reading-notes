## What is Git?
- Git is the most widely used example of a Version Control System, a system which tracks changes made to code over time and allows developers to revert to previous versions if neccesary. 
- In Git, cloning is the process of making a copy of a project so a developer can make changes to existing code. 
- Common commands in Git include: 
  - "add" which tells Git that a file should be tracked 
  - "commit" which creates a record of any changes to tracked files
  - "push" which sends the changed files to a remote version of the project where changes can be reviewed by other developers.
