# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset believes that a person's ability and talent is not unchangable and through effort and commitment someone can achieve almost anything they'd like to. 

This takes the form of seeing challenges and failures as simply '*bumps in the road*' on the path to achievement and in fact essential while learning something new. 

> "It’s not that I'm so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer." - Albert Einstein

## How to maintain a growth mindset

- Remind yourself that everyone that is great at anything didn't start out that way
- View challenging experiences as opportunities to learn
- Welcome constructive criticism and take advice
